If import spacy creates an error of the following type:
ValueError: numpy.dtype size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. Expected 96 from C header, got 88 from PyObject

The error you're encountering is related to a version mismatch between numpy and spacy, which can occur when different versions of libraries are not fully compatible with each other. Here's how you can resolve this issue:

Step 1: Update numpy
Start by ensuring that numpy is updated to the latest version:
pip install --upgrade numpy

Step 2: Reinstall spacy
Sometimes, reinstalling spacy after updating numpy can resolve the issue:
pip uninstall spacy
pip install spacy

Step 3: Check for Compatibility
If the problem persists, ensure that all related libraries (spacy, numpy, etc.) are compatible. You can do this by specifying versions known to work well together:
pip install numpy==1.24.2 spacy==3.5.0

Step 4: Rebuild the spacy Model
If you've already installed a model like en_core_web_sm, you may need to reinstall it:
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

Step 5: Restart the Kernel
After performing these updates, restart your Jupyter notebook kernel to ensure that the changes take effect.
